# What is this?

This extension is a quick extension I made to enforce good coding habits and make you put a semicolon at the end of your JavaScript and TypeScript code lines.

This extension is in beta, so be aware that it might not always be perfect.

# How to Use

Literally just install it. There's nothing to configure for now.
